# Chicago-Rats-Be-Gone-D3
üê≠ Interactive data visualization project regarding Chicago's rat complaints using d3.js

## Project Description
In recent years, Chicago has been receiving increasing numbers of rodent infestation complaints. It is important for the city government to actively engage in resolving rat complaints, as rats can cause huge property damage and spread harmful pathogens to humans. This interactive visualization project illustrates the severity and patterns of rat complaints within the city of Chicago, and seeks to help policymakers to find effective measures to mitigate rodent problems. It consists of a storytelling section where viewers can scroll to interact directly with the 311 data of different US cities, and a dashboard section where viewers can see the rat complaints at the Chicago community level.
